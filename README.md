# Hi there 👋

- 💥 I’m currently attending Code Platoon's full-stack software engineering program and learning about web dev in react.js.
- 🤓 I started coding with Python in 2017, although my first exposure to programming was with C++ class I took back in 2012. I studied computational data analytics through Georgia Tech's online master's program and have completed projects in Python, JavaScript, and R.
